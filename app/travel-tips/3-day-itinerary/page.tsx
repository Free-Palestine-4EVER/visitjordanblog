          Only have 3 days to explore Jordan? While it's a short time to experience everything this beautiful country
          has to offer, you can still visit the most iconic sites with this carefully crafted itinerary. This fast-paced
          schedule focuses on the absolute must-see attractions to make the most of your limited time.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1: Amman Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Morning:</strong> Begin your Jordan adventure in the capital city of Amman. Start with a visit to the
          Citadel (Jabal al-Qal'a), offering panoramic views of the city and home to important historical structures
          including the Temple of Hercules and the Umayyad Palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Afternoon:</strong> Explore the impressive Roman Theater, a 6,000-seat ancient amphitheater dating
          back to the 2nd century. Afterward, wander through the vibrant streets of downtown Amman, visiting the souks
          (markets) and sampling local street food.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Evening:</strong> Enjoy dinner at one of Amman's rooftop restaurants in the trendy Rainbow Street
          area, offering delicious Jordanian cuisine and beautiful city views.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Stay overnight in Amman.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 2: Petra - The Rose City</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Early Morning:</strong> Depart early from Amman for the approximately 3-hour drive to Petra. An early
          start is essential to maximize your time at this Wonder of the World.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Day:</strong> Spend the entire day exploring the ancient Nabatean city of Petra. Enter through the
          dramatic Siq (narrow gorge) to reach the iconic Treasury (Al-Khazneh). Continue to explore the Royal Tombs,
          the Monastery (if you have the energy for the climb), and other remarkable structures carved into the
          rose-colored sandstone cliffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Evening:</strong> Consider experiencing "Petra by Night" if your visit coincides with this special
          event (Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights), where the Siq and Treasury are illuminated by thousands of
          candles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accommodation:</strong> Stay overnight in Wadi Musa (the town adjacent to Petra).
        </p>

        <h2>Day 3: Dead Sea Experience</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Morning:</strong> After breakfast, drive to the Dead Sea (approximately 3 hours from Petra).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Afternoon:</strong> Spend your final day floating in the mineral-rich waters of the Dead Sea, the
          lowest point on Earth. Apply the famous Dead Sea mud, known for its therapeutic properties, and relax on the
          shores of this natural wonder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Evening:</strong> Enjoy a sunset dinner at your resort before departing or spending one final night in
          Jordan.
        </p>
