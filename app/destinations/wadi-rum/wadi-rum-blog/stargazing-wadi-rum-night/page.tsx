        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li>A camera with manual settings (DSLR or mirrorless preferred)</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Cultural Significance</h2>

        <p>
          For the Bedouin people, the stars have always been more than just beautiful lights in the sky. They were
          essential navigation tools and timekeepers. Many Bedouin guides can share fascinating stories about how their
          ancestors used the stars to navigate the vast desert and predict seasonal changes.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">
          Stargazing in Wadi Rum is more than just an astronomical experience—it's a connection to the ancient human
          tradition of looking up in wonder. As you lie back on the desert sand, gazing at the same stars that guided
          Lawrence of Arabia and countless Bedouin travelers before him, you'll understand why this experience is truly
          unforgettable.
