        <h2>The Ancient City of Gadara</h2>
        <p>
          Perched on a hilltop overlooking the Sea of Galilee, the Golan Heights, and the Jordan Valley, Umm Qais is
          home to the impressive ruins of ancient Gadara, one of the most important Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis
          League. Founded in the 4th century BCE, Gadara flourished as a cultural and intellectual center, known for its
          philosophers, poets, and artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the archaeological site offers visitors a fascinating journey through time, with remarkably preserved
          ruins spanning multiple civilizations. What makes Umm Qais particularly unique is the use of black basalt
          stone in many of its structures, creating a striking contrast with the surrounding landscape and
          distinguishing it from other ancient sites in Jordan.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Quick Facts: Ancient Gadara</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li>✓ Founded in the 4th century BCE</li>
            <li>✓ Member of the Decapolis League of Roman cities</li>
            <li>✓ Known for its strategic location and panoramic views</li>
            <li>✓ Famous for black basalt stone architecture</li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Main Attractions of Umm Qais Archaeological Site</h2>

        <h3>The Western Theater</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most impressive structures at Umm Qais is the Western Theater, built in the 2nd century CE. Unlike
          many Roman theaters that were built into hillsides, this theater was constructed entirely of black basalt
          blocks. Although smaller than the theaters at Jerash or Amman, seating about 3,000 spectators, its unique
          black stone construction and excellent state of preservation make it a highlight of any visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the upper rows of the theater, visitors can enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of the Sea of Galilee and
          the surrounding countryside—the same views that would have been appreciated by theatergoers nearly 2,000 years
          ago.
        </p>

        <h3>The Basilica Terrace</h3>
        <p>
          Adjacent to the theater is the Basilica Terrace, a large open area that once served as the city's main public
          space. Here you'll find the remains of a 6th-century Byzantine church with beautiful mosaic floors, some of
          which are still visible. The basilica's columns—some standing, others toppled by earthquakes—give a sense of
          the grandeur this structure once possessed.
        </p>

        <h3>The Colonnaded Street</h3>
        <p>
          No Roman city would be complete without a grand colonnaded street, and Gadara is no exception. The main
          street, which runs east-west through the site, was once lined with shops, public buildings, and elegant
          columns. Today, many of these basalt columns have been re-erected, allowing visitors to imagine the bustling
          ancient thoroughfare as it would have appeared during the city's heyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for the chariot wheel ruts still visible in some of the paving stones—tangible evidence of the daily life
          that once animated these streets.
        </p>

        <h3>The Nymphaeum</h3>
        <p>
          The city's nymphaeum, or public fountain, was an elaborate structure that provided fresh water to residents
          and visitors. Though only partially preserved, you can still see elements of its decorative architecture and
          water distribution system, highlighting the advanced engineering skills of the ancient Romans.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ottoman Village</h3>
        <p>
          One of the unique aspects of Umm Qais is the presence of an Ottoman-era village built directly on top of part
          of the ancient city. These 19th-century stone buildings, constructed using materials repurposed from the Roman
          ruins, now house a small museum and restaurant. This layering of history provides a fascinating glimpse into
          how the site continued to be inhabited and adapted over centuries.
        </p>

        <h3>The Underground Mausoleum</h3>
        <p>
          Less visited but equally fascinating is the underground mausoleum, located near the western edge of the site.
          This tomb complex features several burial chambers cut into the rock, with some sarcophagi still in place. The
          cool, quiet atmosphere of this space offers a contemplative contrast to the open-air ruins above.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Visitor's Tip</h3>
          <p className="italic">
            "The late afternoon is the best time to visit Umm Qais. The softer light brings out the texture of the black
            basalt stones, and if you stay until sunset, you'll be treated to a spectacular display of colors over the
            Sea of Galilee. Just be sure to arrange transportation back to your accommodation in advance, as taxis can
            be scarce in the evening."
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Historical Significance of Gadara</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond its impressive physical remains, Gadara holds significant historical and cultural importance. The city
          was renowned as an intellectual center during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, home to notable philosophers,
          writers, and poets, including Meleager of Gadara, an important epigrammatist of the 1st century BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gadara also appears in biblical accounts, as the region where, according to the New Testament, Jesus performed
          the miracle of the Gadarene swine, casting demons out of a man and into a herd of pigs that then ran down the
          steep hillside into the Sea of Galilee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout its history, Gadara changed hands multiple times, coming under Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Hasmonean, and
          finally Roman rule before becoming part of the Byzantine Empire. Each civilization left its mark on the city,
          contributing to the rich archaeological tapestry visible today.
        </p>
