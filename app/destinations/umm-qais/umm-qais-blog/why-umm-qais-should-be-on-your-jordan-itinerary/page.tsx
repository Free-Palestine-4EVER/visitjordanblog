            <span className="font-bold">TRAVEL INSIGHT:</span> While most travelers to Jordan focus on Petra, Wadi Rum,
            and the Dead Sea, northern Jordan offers equally remarkable experiences with far fewer crowds. Umm Qais
            stands out as perhaps the most underrated archaeological site in the country.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          When planning a trip to Jordan, certain destinations immediately come to mind: the rose-red city of Petra, the
          otherworldly landscapes of Wadi Rum, the buoyant waters of the Dead Sea. These iconic sites certainly deserve
          their fame, but focusing solely on them means missing out on some of Jordan's most extraordinary
          experiences—chief among them, the ancient city of Umm Qais (Gadara).
        </p>

        <p>
          Perched on a hilltop in the far north of Jordan, Umm Qais offers a compelling blend of spectacular ruins,
          breathtaking views, and authentic cultural experiences that make it a worthy addition to any Jordan itinerary.
          Yet many travelers overlook this remarkable site, either unaware of its existence or deterred by its distance
          from the more famous southern attractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This article makes the case for why Umm Qais deserves a place on your Jordan travel itinerary, highlighting
          the unique experiences and perspectives it offers that you simply won't find elsewhere in the country—or
          indeed, in the entire Middle East.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">1. The Most Spectacular Views in Jordan</h2>

        <p>
          Without question, Umm Qais boasts what might be the most extraordinary panoramic view in all of Jordan. From
          its commanding position on a hill in the northwestern corner of the country, visitors are treated to a
          sweeping vista that spans three countries and landscapes of profound historical and religious significance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Standing at the western edge of the archaeological site, you can gaze out over the shimmering waters of the
          Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberias) in Israel, the undulating hills of the Golan Heights in Syria, and the verdant
          Yarmouk River valley that forms part of the border between Jordan and Syria. On clear days, you might even
          glimpse the snow-capped peak of Mount Hermon in the distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          This tri-country view offers a perspective that transcends modern political boundaries, connecting visitors to
          the shared geographical and historical context of the Levant region. It's a view that helps explain why this
          location has been strategically important since ancient times, commanding key trade routes and military
          positions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The view is particularly magical at sunset, when the sinking sun bathes the landscape in golden light and
          creates shimmering reflections on the Sea of Galilee. As darkness falls, you can see the twinkling lights of
          settlements in three different countries—a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of this historically
          significant region.
        </p>

          <div className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
            The distinctive black basalt architecture of Umm Qais creates a striking contrast with the blue waters of
            the Sea of Galilee
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">2. Unique Black Basalt Architecture</h2>

        <p>
          While many Roman ruins throughout the Mediterranean world feature similar architectural elements, Umm Qais
          stands apart for its distinctive use of black basalt stone. This volcanic material, sourced locally, gives the
          site a dramatic and unique appearance that you won't find at other archaeological sites in Jordan.
        </p>

        <p>
          The black basalt creates striking visual contrasts: dark columns against blue skies, black stone buildings
          alongside white limestone structures, and shadowy arcades that frame bright vistas. For photographers, these
          contrasts offer exceptional creative opportunities, particularly in the golden light of early morning or late
          afternoon.
        </p>

        <p>
          The use of basalt wasn't merely aesthetic—it reflected the practical use of locally available materials and
          demonstrated the Roman ability to adapt their architectural techniques to different environments and
          resources. The durability of basalt has also helped preserve many features of the site, allowing visitors
          today to appreciate structures that have withstood nearly two millennia of weathering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Walking among the black colonnades and buildings of Umm Qais provides a distinctly different experience from
          exploring the more common limestone and marble ruins found elsewhere in Jordan and throughout the former Roman
          Empire. This architectural uniqueness alone makes Umm Qais worth the journey to northern Jordan.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">
          3. A Journey Through Multiple Historical Periods
        </h2>

        <p>
          Unlike some archaeological sites that showcase a single historical period, Umm Qais offers visitors a
          remarkable journey through multiple eras of human history, all in one compact location. This layering of
          historical periods creates a fascinating palimpsest that tells a more complete story of the region's past.
        </p>

        <p>
          The site's history begins in the Hellenistic period (4th century BC) when it was founded as Gadara and
          developed into an important cultural center. The Roman era (63 BC onwards) brought monumental architecture
          including the theater, colonnaded streets, and public buildings that form the most visible remains today.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Byzantine period (4th-7th centuries AD) added Christian elements to the city, including churches and
          religious symbols. Later, the site witnessed the early Islamic period, though fewer structures remain from
          this era. Perhaps most unusually, Umm Qais also preserves an Ottoman-era village built directly atop the
          ancient ruins, with stone houses constructed using materials repurposed from the Greco-Roman city.
        </p>

        <p>
          This historical layering allows visitors to trace the evolution of a single settlement across more than two
          millennia, offering insights into how successive civilizations adapted, reused, and transformed the urban
          landscape. Few sites in Jordan—or indeed the wider Middle East—present such a clear and accessible record of
          historical continuity and change.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6">
          <p className="font-medium text-blue-800">
            <span className="font-bold">HISTORICAL NOTE:</span> Gadara was renowned in the ancient world as an
            intellectual center, home to poets, philosophers, and mathematicians. It was sometimes called "the Athens of
            the East" for its cultural significance in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">4. Biblical Connections</h2>

        <p>
          For travelers interested in biblical history, Umm Qais holds special significance as the likely setting for
          one of Jesus's most dramatic miracles. According to the Gospels (Matthew 8:28-34, Mark 5:1-20, and Luke
          8:26-39), Jesus encountered a man (or men, depending on the account) possessed by demons in the "country of
          the Gadarenes" or "Gerasenes."
        </p>

        <p>
          In this well-known story, Jesus cast the demons out of the man and into a herd of swine, which then rushed
          down a steep bank into the Sea of Galilee and drowned. Standing at Umm Qais today, visitors can see the
          geographical features that match this biblical account: the steep slopes descending from the plateau toward
          the waters of the Sea of Galilee below.
        </p>

        <p>
          This connection adds another dimension to a visit, allowing travelers to visualize a biblical narrative in its
          actual geographical context. For those on a pilgrimage or with an interest in religious history, Umm Qais
          provides a tangible link to New Testament events that complements visits to other biblical sites in Jordan,
          such as Bethany Beyond the Jordan (the baptism site) and Mount Nebo.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Byzantine-era remains at Umm Qais, including the basilica terrace, also testify to the early Christian
          presence in the region, offering insights into how the new faith transformed the urban landscape of formerly
          pagan cities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">5. Authentic Cultural Experiences</h2>

        <p>
          Beyond its archaeological and scenic value, Umm Qais offers visitors opportunities for authentic cultural
          experiences that are increasingly hard to find in Jordan's more heavily touristed areas. The site's relative
          remoteness and lower visitor numbers have helped preserve a more genuine atmosphere that connects travelers to
          local traditions and ways of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the highlights is dining at Beit Al Rousan, a restaurant housed in a beautifully restored Ottoman-era
          building within the archaeological site. Here, you can enjoy traditional Jordanian cuisine prepared with
          locally-sourced ingredients while taking in the spectacular views over the Sea of Galilee. Unlike more
          tourist-oriented restaurants, Beit Al Rousan serves authentic regional specialties and often hosts local
          families, creating a more immersive cultural experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The surrounding area is still predominantly rural, with olive groves, orchards, and small farms dotting the
          landscape. Visitors who take time to explore beyond the archaeological site can observe traditional
          agricultural practices that have changed little over centuries. During the olive harvest season
          (October-November), you might even be invited to participate in the picking or watch the pressing process at a
          local mill.
        </p>

        <p>
          The nearby village of Umm Qais is home to several artisans who maintain traditional crafts, including basket
          weaving, pottery, and olive wood carving. Some offer workshops where visitors can learn about these ancient
          techniques and try their hand at creating their own souvenirs—a far more meaningful experience than purchasing
          mass-produced items from tourist shops.
        </p>

        <div className="relative w-full h-[350px] my-8 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

        </div>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">6. Escape the Crowds</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most compelling reasons to include Umm Qais in your Jordan itinerary is the opportunity to
          experience an archaeological site of tremendous significance without the crowds that can sometimes diminish
          the experience at more famous destinations. While Petra might see thousands of visitors daily during peak
          season, Umm Qais offers a more contemplative atmosphere where you can explore at your own pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          This relative tranquility allows for a more intimate connection with history. You can sit in the ancient
          theater without dozens of other tourists in your photos, walk the colonnaded street in peaceful reflection, or
          spend time sketching or photographing the ruins without feeling rushed or crowded. The silence—broken only by
          birdsong and the distant sounds of rural life—enhances the sense of stepping back in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many travelers, these quieter moments become the most memorable parts of their Jordan journey, offering a
          welcome contrast to the busier experiences at major attractions. The opportunity to have such a significant
          historical site largely to yourself is increasingly rare in global tourism and represents a special privilege
          that Umm Qais still offers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even during Jordan's high tourist seasons (March-May and September-November), Umm Qais rarely feels crowded.
          Visit on a weekday morning, and you might share the entire site with just a handful of other visitors,
          creating an almost private experience of this remarkable place.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-6">
          <p className="font-medium text-green-800">
            <span className="font-bold">TRAVELER'S TIP:</span> If you visit during the Jordanian weekend
            (Friday-Saturday), you'll likely encounter more local visitors, especially families. While this means more
            people at the site, it offers a wonderful opportunity to observe how Jordanians enjoy their own heritage and
            to potentially engage in cultural exchange.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">7. Gateway to Northern Jordan's Treasures</h2>

        <p>
          Including Umm Qais in your itinerary opens the door to exploring Jordan's northern region, an area rich in
          historical sites, natural beauty, and cultural experiences that many travelers miss entirely. Using Umm Qais
          as an anchor point, you can create a northern circuit that showcases a different side of Jordan than the more
          familiar southern attractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just 40 kilometers east of Umm Qais lies Irbid, Jordan's second-largest city and home to Yarmouk University,
          giving it a youthful, energetic atmosphere. The city's archaeological museum houses an impressive collection
          of artifacts from northern Jordan, providing context for the sites you'll visit. Irbid also offers excellent
          local restaurants serving northern Jordanian specialties that differ subtly from the cuisine found in Amman.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further south, the magnificent ruins of Jerash present one of the best-preserved Roman provincial cities in
          the world. The extensive site features colonnaded streets, theaters, temples, and churches that complement
          what you'll see at Umm Qais, offering a more complete picture of Roman urban planning and architecture in the
          region.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nearby Ajloun Castle, a 12th-century Muslim fortress built to protect the region from Crusader incursions,
          provides a fascinating contrast to the Greco-Roman sites. Set amid pine forests and olive groves, the castle
          offers panoramic views of the Jordan Valley and tells the story of the region during the medieval period.
        </p>

        <p>
          These northern sites can be combined into a 2-3 day itinerary that showcases the diversity of Jordan's
          historical and cultural heritage, creating a more balanced and complete experience of the country than the
          standard tourist route focused exclusively on southern attractions.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">8. Photographic Opportunities</h2>

        <p>
          For photography enthusiasts, Umm Qais offers some of the most distinctive and dramatic shooting opportunities
          in Jordan. The combination of unique architectural elements, spectacular natural settings, and special
          lighting conditions creates endless possibilities for memorable images.
        </p>

        <p>
          The black basalt architecture provides striking visual contrasts against blue skies and green landscapes,
          while the panoramic views offer sweeping vistas that showcase the natural beauty of the region. The late
          afternoon golden hour is particularly magical, as the low sun casts long shadows across the ruins and bathes
          the stone in warm light.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sunset at Umm Qais is a photographer's dream, as the sun sinks toward the horizon beyond the Sea of Galilee,
          creating a spectacular backdrop for silhouettes of ancient columns and structures. After sunset, the blue hour
          brings a serene quality to the landscape, with the distant lights of settlements in three countries creating
          points of interest in the deepening twilight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the day, changing light conditions transform the appearance of the ruins, rewarding photographers
          who can spend several hours at the site. Morning mist sometimes fills the valley below in winter months,
          creating ethereal scenes as the ancient city appears to float above the clouds. Spring brings wildflowers that
          add splashes of color among the dark stones.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">9. Sustainable Tourism Choice</h2>

        <p>
          By including Umm Qais in your Jordan itinerary, you're making a choice that supports more sustainable and
          balanced tourism development in the country. While sites like Petra face challenges related to overtourism
          during peak seasons, northern Jordan's archaeological treasures benefit from increased visitor numbers that
          help fund conservation efforts and support local communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tourism revenue at Umm Qais directly benefits the local community, with residents employed as site guides,
          restaurant staff, and artisans. Several community-based tourism initiatives have developed around the site,
          including homestay opportunities, cooking classes, and guided nature walks led by local experts. These
          programs provide economic opportunities in a region that has traditionally seen less development than other
          parts of Jordan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Environmentally, visiting northern Jordan helps reduce the concentration of tourism impacts on more fragile
          ecosystems in the south, such as Wadi Rum and the Dead Sea. The Mediterranean climate of the north also means
          that water—a precious resource in Jordan—is somewhat less scarce than in the desert regions, making tourism
          potentially more sustainable.
        </p>

        <p>
          For travelers concerned about the social and environmental impacts of their choices, spreading their time and
          spending across different regions of Jordan represents a more responsible approach to experiencing the
          country. Including Umm Qais in your itinerary contributes to this more balanced model of tourism development.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-800">10. A Different Perspective on Jordan</h2>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most compelling reason to include Umm Qais in your Jordan itinerary is the opportunity it provides
          to gain a more complete and nuanced understanding of the country. While the southern attractions showcase
          Jordan's desert landscapes and Nabataean heritage, the northern sites reveal different aspects of the nation's
          identity and history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Northern Jordan, with its Mediterranean climate, fertile valleys, and ancient Greco-Roman cities, connects
          more visibly to the wider Levantine cultural sphere that includes parts of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and
          Israel. This regional context helps visitors understand Jordan's position at the crossroads of civilizations
          and its role in the historical development of the Middle East.
        </p>

        <p>
          The agricultural landscapes around Umm Qais—with olive groves, wheat fields, and orchards—reveal the
          importance of farming in Jordan's economy and culture, a contrast to the pastoral Bedouin traditions more
          commonly associated with the country. The rural villages of the north offer glimpses of everyday Jordanian
          life outside the urban centers and tourist hubs.
        </p>

        <p>
          By experiencing both northern and southern Jordan, travelers gain a more balanced perspective on the country's
          geographical diversity, historical complexity, and cultural richness. This fuller understanding makes for a
          more rewarding journey and deeper appreciation of Jordan as more than just the sum of its famous attractions.

          The simplest way to experience Umm Qais is as a day trip from Amman. The drive takes approximately 2 hours
          each way, allowing for 3-4 hours at the site—enough time to explore the ruins, enjoy the views, and have lunch
          at Beit Al Rousan. This option works well for travelers with limited time who are using Amman as their base.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a more comprehensive day trip, combine Umm Qais with a visit to Jerash, stopping at both sites in a single
          day. This makes for a long but rewarding day (about 10-12 hours total) that showcases two of Jordan's most
          important Greco-Roman cities. Start early at Jerash to avoid midday heat, then continue to Umm Qais for the
          afternoon and sunset.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-700">Northern Jordan Circuit (2-3 Days)</h3>

        <p>
          A more leisurely approach is to dedicate 2-3 days to northern Jordan, staying overnight in either Irbid or at
          one of the guesthouses near Umm Qais. This allows you to explore the region in greater depth and at a more
          relaxed pace. A sample itinerary might look like this:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Day 1:</strong> Depart Amman in the morning for Jerash. Spend 3-4 hours exploring the extensive
            ruins. Continue to Ajloun Castle for the afternoon. Overnight in Ajloun Forest Reserve or Irbid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Day 2:</strong> Travel to Umm Qais in the morning. Spend the full day exploring the archaeological
            site, hiking in the surrounding area, and enjoying a leisurely lunch. Stay for sunset. Overnight near Umm
            Qais or return to Irbid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Day 3:</strong> Visit Pella, another Decapolis city with impressive ruins in a beautiful valley
            setting. Return to Amman in the afternoon, or continue to the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea.
          </li>
        </ul>
