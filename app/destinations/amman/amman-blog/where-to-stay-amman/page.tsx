          <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>

          <h3>Transportation</h3>
          <p>
            Amman is built on seven hills (though it has expanded to cover many more), which means steep streets and
            sometimes challenging walks. Consider this when choosing your neighborhood, especially if you have mobility
            concerns. While taxis and ride-sharing apps are readily available throughout the city, staying in a central
            location can save you time and money on transportation.
          </p>

          <h3>Budget</h3>
          <p>
            Accommodation prices vary significantly between neighborhoods. Downtown and parts of Jabal Al-Weibdeh offer
            the most budget-friendly options, while Abdoun and the 5th Circle area have the most luxury accommodations.
            Consider what amenities are most important to you and where you're willing to compromise.
          </p>

          <h3>Length of Stay</h3>
          <p>
            For short visits (1-3 days), staying near the main attractions in Jabal Amman or Downtown makes sense. For
            longer stays, you might prefer the residential comfort of Abdoun or Sweifieh, or consider an apartment
            rental in Jabal Al-Weibdeh for a more local experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p>
            Amman is generally a very safe city by global standards. All the neighborhoods mentioned above are suitable
            for tourists, though as in any city, basic precautions should be taken, especially at night. Women travelers
            should note that Downtown can sometimes feel more conservative and may attract more attention than the more
            cosmopolitan areas like Jabal Amman or Abdoun.
          </p>

          <h2>Accommodation Types in Amman</h2>

          <h3>Luxury Hotels</h3>
          <p>
            Amman boasts several international luxury hotel chains, primarily located in Abdoun, the 5th Circle area,
            and Shmeisani. These hotels offer world-class amenities, including swimming pools, spas, and multiple dining
            options. Expect to pay $150-300+ per night.
          </p>

          <h3>Boutique Hotels</h3>
          <p>
            For a more personalized experience, Amman has a growing number of boutique hotels, particularly in Jabal
            Amman and Jabal Al-Weibdeh. These often occupy renovated historic buildings and offer unique design elements
            along with personalized service. Prices range from $80-200 per night.
          </p>

          <h3>Mid-range Hotels</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the city, you'll find solid mid-range options offering comfortable accommodations without the
            luxury price tag. These are particularly concentrated in Shmeisani and Sweifieh. Expect to pay $50-100 per
            night.
          </p>

          <h3>Budget Hotels and Hostels</h3>
          <p>
            Downtown Amman has the highest concentration of budget accommodations, with basic hotels and several hostels
            catering to backpackers and budget travelers. Prices start from as low as $15 per night for a dorm bed or
            $30-50 for a basic private room.
          </p>

          <h3>Apartment Rentals</h3>
          <p>
            For longer stays or family travel, apartment rentals can offer better value and more space. These are
            available throughout the city, with particularly good options in Jabal Al-Weibdeh and Jabal Amman for those
            seeking character, or Abdoun and Sweifieh for more modern accommodations.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Recommendations</h2>

          <h3>For First-Time Visitors</h3>
          <p>
            Stay in Jabal Amman (1st-3rd Circle area) for the perfect balance of convenience, charm, and access to major
            attractions. The Canvas Hotel or The House Boutique Suites are excellent choices.
          </p>

          <h3>For Budget Travelers</h3>
          <p>
            Downtown offers the most affordable options while keeping you close to many attractions. Jordan Tower Hotel
            provides good value and a central location.
          </p>

          <h3>For Luxury Seekers</h3>
          <p>
            Abdoun is your best bet, with the Fairmont Amman or Kempinski Hotel offering top-tier accommodations and
            amenities.
          </p>

          <h3>For Families</h3>
          <p>
            Consider Abdoun or the 4th-5th Circle area for quieter, more spacious accommodations with good access to
            parks and family-friendly restaurants.
          </p>

          <h3>For Long-Term Stays</h3>
          <p>
            Jabal Al-Weibdeh offers the best combination of character, convenience, and livability for those staying
            weeks or months in Amman.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whichever neighborhood you choose, Amman's relatively compact size and abundant taxis mean you can easily
            explore other areas of the city. Each district offers its own unique perspective on Jordanian life, and part
            of the joy of visiting Amman is experiencing these different facets of the city.
