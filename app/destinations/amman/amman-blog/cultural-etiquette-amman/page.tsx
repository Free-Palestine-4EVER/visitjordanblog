        <div className="prose">
          <p>
            Amman, the capital of Jordan, is a vibrant city with a rich history and culture. To ensure a smooth and
            respectful visit, understanding local customs and etiquette is essential. This guide provides insights into
            Jordanian cultural norms to help you navigate social situations with grace.
          </p>

          <h2>Personal Space and Interactions</h2>

          <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            Jordanians are generally warm and hospitable people, but cultural norms regarding personal space and
            interactions may differ from what you're accustomed to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Physical proximity</strong>: Jordanians often stand closer to each other during conversations than
              might be customary in Western countries. This is normal and not an invasion of personal space.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cross-gender interactions</strong>: Maintain a respectful distance with members of the opposite
              sex, particularly in more conservative areas like Downtown Amman.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public displays of affection</strong>: Even between married couples, physical affection beyond
              holding hands is generally inappropriate in public. This applies to both opposite-sex and same-sex
              couples.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Dress Code and Appearance</h2>

          <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            While Amman is more cosmopolitan than many Middle Eastern cities, modest dress is still appreciated,
            particularly in certain areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>For women</strong>: Clothing that covers shoulders, chest, and knees is appropriate in most
              situations. In more conservative areas like Downtown or when visiting religious sites, looser clothing and
              covered arms are recommended. A headscarf is not required except when visiting mosques.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For men</strong>: Shorts that reach the knee are acceptable in most tourist areas, but long pants
              are more appropriate for religious sites and traditional neighborhoods. Sleeveless shirts should be
              avoided in conservative areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Swimwear</strong>: Appropriate only at hotel pools and private beach facilities, not in public
              areas. Women might feel more comfortable in more modest swimwear, especially at public facilities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Neighborhood Considerations</h3>
          <p>Dress expectations vary by neighborhood in Amman:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Western Amman</strong> (Abdoun, Sweifieh): More relaxed dress codes, though still more
              conservative than Western countries
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Downtown (Al-Balad)</strong>: More traditional area where modest dress is particularly important
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Religious sites</strong>: Most conservative dress required, with covered arms and legs for all
              visitors, and headscarves for women entering mosques
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Upscale restaurants and hotels</strong>: Smart casual attire similar to Western standards
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Dining Etiquette</h2>

          <h3>Traditional Jordanian Hospitality</h3>
          <p>
            Food plays a central role in Jordanian hospitality, and understanding dining customs enhances the
            experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Accepting invitations</strong>: If invited to a Jordanian home, it's polite to bring a small gift
              such as sweets, fruit, or flowers. Avoid alcohol unless you're certain your host drinks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refusing food or drink</strong>: Declining offered food or drink can be perceived as rejecting
              hospitality. It's better to accept at least a small amount. If you must decline, do so graciously with a
              hand over your heart.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compliments</strong>: Complimenting the food is always appreciated. Jordanians take great pride in
              their cuisine and hospitality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second and third helpings</strong>: Hosts will often insist you take more food. A polite refusal
              is expected initially, but your host may continue to offer. This is part of Jordanian generosity.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Table Manners</h3>
          <p>Whether dining in a home or restaurant, these customs apply:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hand usage</strong>: The right hand is used for eating, particularly when sharing communal dishes
              or eating with your hands. The left hand is traditionally considered unclean.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communal dining</strong>: Many Jordanian meals are served family-style with shared plates. Take
              food from the section of the communal dish closest to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bread etiquette</strong>: Bread is often used as a utensil to scoop up food. Never waste bread or
              throw it away â€“ it's considered sacred in many Middle Eastern cultures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finishing your plate</strong>: While cleaning your plate shows appreciation in some cultures, in
              Jordan, it's better to leave a small amount of food to show you've had enough and were satisfied.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Coffee and Tea Customs</h3>
          <p>Coffee and tea ceremonies have special significance in Jordanian culture:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Arabic coffee (qahwa)</strong>: Traditionally served in small cups without handles. Hold the cup
              with your right hand and return it with the same hand. Shake the cup slightly when you've had enough to
              indicate you don't want a refill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tea service</strong>: Tea is often served very sweet unless you specify otherwise. It's polite to
              accept at least one cup when offered.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Timing</strong>: Coffee or tea is often served before a meal or business discussion. It's
              considered impolite to rush this ritual by immediately discussing business.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Religious and Cultural Sensitivities</h2>

          <h3>Respecting Islam</h3>
          <p>While Jordan is relatively moderate, respecting Islamic customs is important:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Prayer times</strong>: Five times daily, you'll hear the call to prayer from mosques throughout
              Amman. Be respectful during these times, particularly on Fridays (the Muslim holy day) around midday
              prayer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ramadan considerations</strong>: If visiting during the holy month of Ramadan, avoid eating,
              drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours. Many restaurants will be closed until sunset, though
              some tourist establishments remain open.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mosque etiquette</strong>: Remove shoes before entering, dress modestly (women should cover their
              hair), speak quietly, and avoid walking in front of people who are praying. Some mosques are not open to
              non-Muslims, so always check before entering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Religious discussions</strong>: While many Jordanians are open to discussing religion, approach
              such conversations respectfully and avoid criticism or proselytizing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Photography Etiquette</h3>
          <p>Be mindful when taking photographs in Amman:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>People</strong>: Always ask permission before photographing individuals, especially women and
              children. Some people may decline for religious or personal reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Religious sites</strong>: Photography may be restricted in certain areas of mosques and other
              religious buildings. Look for signs or ask before taking pictures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Government buildings and military installations</strong>: Avoid photographing these as it may be
              prohibited and could lead to questioning by authorities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Business and Shopping Etiquette</h2>

          <h3>Business Interactions</h3>
          <p>If conducting business in Amman, be aware of these cultural norms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Relationship building</strong>: Business in Jordan is relationship-based. Expect to spend time
              getting to know your counterparts before discussing business matters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meeting punctuality</strong>: While you should aim to be on time, be prepared for Jordanian
              colleagues to operate on a more relaxed schedule. Flexibility is appreciated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business cards</strong>: Exchange with both hands or with the right hand. If your cards are
              bilingual (English/Arabic), present them with the Arabic side facing the recipient.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decision-making</strong>: Decisions may take longer than in Western business cultures, as
              consensus-building and consultation are valued.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Bargaining in Markets</h3>
          <p>Haggling is expected in traditional markets (souks) but not in fixed-price establishments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Where to bargain</strong>: Traditional markets, independent souvenir shops, and with taxi drivers
              (if not using the meter)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Where not to bargain</strong>: Supermarkets, department stores, and upscale boutiques with marked
              prices
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bargaining etiquette</strong>: Keep negotiations friendly and good-humored. Start around 60-70% of
              the asking price and work toward a mutually acceptable figure. Walking away is a legitimate tactic but do
              so politely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Commitment</strong>: Only begin serious bargaining if you're genuinely interested in purchasing.
              Reaching an agreement and then backing out is considered rude.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Navigating Specific Situations</h2>

          <h3>Home Visits</h3>
          <p>If invited to a Jordanian home, these customs will help you be a gracious guest:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Shoes</strong>: Look for cues about whether to remove your shoes at the entrance. If you see shoes
              by the door, follow suit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Seating</strong>: Wait to be told where to sit. The most honored position is often farthest from
              the door.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compliments</strong>: Admire your host's home, but avoid excessive praise of specific items, as
              your host may feel obligated to give them to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Length of visit</strong>: Visits tend to be longer than in Western cultures. Plan to stay at least
              an hour, and follow your host's cues about when it's appropriate to leave.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
          <p>When using buses or shared taxis in Amman:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Gender considerations</strong>: Women should ideally sit next to other women when possible,
              particularly in more crowded conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Priority seating</strong>: Offer your seat to elderly passengers, pregnant women, or those with
              small children.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal space</strong>: Public transportation can be crowded. Keep personal belongings secure and
              minimize physical contact with others.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Cultural Faux Pas to Avoid</h2>
          <p>These common mistakes can cause unintentional offense:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Public displays of anger</strong>: Losing your temper or raising your voice is considered
              embarrassing and inappropriate. Maintain composure even in frustrating situations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pointing with your finger or foot</strong>: Pointing directly at someone with your index finger is
              considered rude. Similarly, showing the sole of your foot or pointing with your foot is offensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public intoxication</strong>: While alcohol is legal and available in Amman, public drunkenness is
              frowned upon and may attract negative attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Discussing sensitive political topics</strong>: Avoid critical comments about the Jordanian
              government, royal family, or contentious regional issues unless your Jordanian companions initiate such
              discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rushing relationships</strong>: Building trust takes time in Jordanian culture. Pushing too
              quickly to business or personal matters can seem insincere.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Navigating Cultural Differences with Grace</h2>
          <p>Even with the best intentions, cultural misunderstandings can occur. Here's how to handle them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Apologize sincerely</strong> if you realize you've made a cultural mistake
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ask questions respectfully</strong> when you're unsure about appropriate behavior
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Observe locals</strong> for cues about proper etiquette in unfamiliar situations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Show appreciation</strong> for Jordanian customs and traditions
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remember that intent matters</strong> - most Jordanians are understanding of cultural differences
              and appreciate visitors who make an effort to respect local customs
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Understanding and respecting Jordanian cultural norms will significantly enhance your experience in Amman.
            While the guidelines above provide a framework for appropriate behavior, remember that Jordanian society is
            diverse and evolving. Urban areas like Amman, particularly in western neighborhoods, tend to be more
            cosmopolitan and relaxed about certain traditions. However, showing respect for local customs demonstrates
            your appreciation for Jordanian culture and will open doors to more authentic interactions and experiences
            during your visit.
