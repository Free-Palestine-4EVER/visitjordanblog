          <h3>Falafel</h3>
          <p>
            These crispy, deep-fried chickpea patties are perhaps the most beloved street food in Amman. Jordanian
            falafel is distinguished by its vibrant green interior (from fresh herbs) and perfectly crisp exterior.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hashem Restaurant</strong> (Downtown) - A legendary establishment that has served falafel to
              everyone from locals to royalty since 1952. Their recipe hasn't changed in decades, and the restaurant's
              no-frills atmosphere is part of its charm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Al-Quds Falafel</strong> (Downtown) - Another institution known for exceptionally crispy falafel
              served with fresh-baked bread, tomatoes, and mint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Falafel Al-Quds</strong> (Jabal Al-Hussein) - Not to be confused with the above, this spot is

          </ul>

          </p>

          <h3>Knafeh</h3>
          <p>
            While technically a dessert, knafeh is often enjoyed as a street food in Amman. This sweet cheese pastry

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>How to eat it:</strong> Knafeh is served hot, cut into squares or rectangles, and often placed
            between two pieces of bread to make it easier to eat on the go. The contrast between the sweet, warm knafeh
            and the plain bread is part of the experience.
