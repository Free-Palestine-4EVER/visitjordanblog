            Jordanian cuisine is a delicious reflection of the country's history, geography, and cultural influences. In
            Amman, you'll find everything from street food stalls to upscale restaurants serving traditional dishes that
            have been perfected over generations. This guide will introduce you to the must-try foods and the best
            places to find them in Jordan's capital city.
          </p>

          <h2>Mansaf: Jordan's National Dish</h2>
          <p>
            No culinary exploration of Jordan would be complete without trying mansaf, the country's beloved national
            dish. This celebratory meal consists of tender lamb cooked in a fermented dried yogurt sauce called jameed,
            served over a bed of aromatic rice and topped with toasted almonds and pine nuts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditionally eaten communally with the right hand, mansaf is more than just food—it's a cultural experience
            that represents Jordanian hospitality and generosity. While it's typically prepared for special occasions
            and gatherings, many restaurants in Amman serve excellent versions daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong> Al-Quds Restaurant on Rainbow Street offers one of the most authentic
            versions in the city, while Sufra Restaurant provides a more upscale dining experience with their perfectly
            executed mansaf.
          </p>

          <h2>Mezze: The Art of Small Dishes</h2>
          <p>
            Mezze is the Middle Eastern tradition of serving multiple small dishes at the beginning of a meal. In Amman,
            a typical mezze spread might include:

          </p>

          <h2>Falafel: The Perfect Street Food</h2>
          <p>
            These deep-fried patties made from ground chickpeas or fava beans mixed with herbs and spices are a staple
            of Jordanian street food. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, falafel is typically served in
            pita bread with tahini sauce, tomatoes, and pickles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong> Al-Quds Falafel in Downtown Amman has been serving some of the city's best
            falafel for decades. Hashem Restaurant is another popular spot known for its consistently excellent falafel.
          </p>

          <h2>Knafeh: The King of Desserts</h2>
          <p>
            This iconic Middle Eastern dessert consists of shredded phyllo dough or semolina dough layered with soft
            white cheese, soaked in sweet syrup, and typically topped with crushed pistachios. The contrast between the
            sweet syrup, slightly salty cheese, and crunchy dough creates an irresistible combination.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong> Habibah Sweets in Downtown Amman is the undisputed king of knafeh in the
            city. Join the queue of locals at this institution that has been perfecting this dessert since 1951.
          </p>

          <h2>Maqluba: The Upside-Down Dish</h2>
          <p>
            Maqluba (which means "upside-down" in Arabic) is a traditional dish made with layers of rice, vegetables,
            and meat (usually chicken or lamb). The ingredients are cooked together in a pot, which is then flipped
            upside down onto a serving plate, creating a dramatic presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong> Tawaheen Al-Hawa offers an excellent version of this home-style dish in a
            comfortable setting.
          </p>

          <h2>Zarb: Bedouin Barbecue</h2>
          <p>
            While traditionally associated with Wadi Rum, several restaurants in Amman now offer zarb, a Bedouin cooking
            method where meat and vegetables are slow-cooked in an underground pit. The result is incredibly tender meat
            with a unique, smoky flavor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where to try it:</strong> Beit Sitti offers zarb as part of their cooking classes and special
            dinners, providing both the delicious food and cultural context.
