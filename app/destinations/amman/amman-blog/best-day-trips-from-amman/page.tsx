            Amman makes an excellent base for exploring Jordan's diverse attractions. Within a few hours' drive of the
            capital, you can float in the mineral-rich waters of the Dead Sea, wander through remarkably preserved Roman
            ruins, explore biblical sites, or hike through stunning nature reserves. This guide covers the best day
            trips from Amman, with practical information to help you plan your excursions.
          </p>

          <h2>The Dead Sea (1 hour from Amman)</h2>
          <p>
            The Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth at 430 meters below sea level, offers a unique experience that
            should be on every visitor's itinerary. The extremely high salt concentration (about 34%) makes it
            impossible to sink, creating the famous floating experience that draws visitors from around the world.
          </p>

          <h3>What to Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Float in the mineral-rich waters</strong> - The main attraction is simply floating effortlessly on
              the surface of the water. Remember not to get the water in your eyes or any cuts (it stings!) and don't
              attempt to swim face-down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apply Dead Sea mud</strong> - The black mud found along the shores is rich in minerals and known
              for its therapeutic properties. Cover yourself in mud, let it dry, and then rinse off in the sea for
              silky-smooth skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Watch the sunset</strong> - The views across to the mountains of Israel and the Palestinian
              Territories are particularly beautiful at sunset.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visit a resort</strong> - Day passes at resorts like Amman Beach, Dead Sea Spa, or O Beach provide
              access to showers, pools, and facilities that make the experience more comfortable.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Getting There</h3>
          <p>The Dead Sea is approximately 55 km southwest of Amman, about a one-hour drive:</p>

            <li>

              time).

            <li>Visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday heat, especially in summer</li>
            <li>Bring water shoes as the salt crystals on the shore can be sharp</li>
            <li>Don't shave the day before or day of your visit</li>
            <li>Bring a book or magazine for the iconic Dead Sea floating photo</li>
            <li>Rinse off thoroughly after your swim to remove the salt</li>
