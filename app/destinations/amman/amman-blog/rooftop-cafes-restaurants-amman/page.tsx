          <h2>Seasonal Considerations</h2>

          <h3>Summer Rooftop Dining (May-September)</h3>
          <p>
            Amman's summer evenings are perfect for rooftop dining, with warm temperatures and virtually no chance of
            rain. However, daytime temperatures can be quite hot:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Look for venues with shade options or retractable covers</li>
            <li>Evening visits are generally more comfortable than daytime</li>
            <li>Many rooftops offer misting systems during peak summer months</li>
            <li>Reservations become more important as locals and tourists seek outdoor dining</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Winter Rooftop Options (November-March)</h3>
          <p>
            While Amman's winters are mild compared to many destinations, evenings can be quite cool, and there is
            occasional rainfall:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Many rooftop venues install temporary enclosures and heaters during winter</li>
            <li>Some places close their rooftops entirely during the coldest months</li>
            <li>Call ahead to confirm if the rooftop is open during winter, especially if it's raining</li>
            <li>Daytime visits can be pleasant even in winter, especially on sunny days</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tips for the Perfect Rooftop Experience</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Timing is everything</strong>: For the most magical experience, time your visit for sunset when
              the city is bathed in golden light and then transitions to twinkling lights
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dress appropriately</strong>: While Amman is relatively liberal, smart-casual attire is
              appropriate for most rooftop venues. Some upscale locations may have dress codes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make reservations</strong>: For the best tables with optimal views, especially at higher-end
              establishments
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider the weather</strong>: Bring a light jacket or wrap for evening visits, even in summer, as
              breezes can be cool at higher elevations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bring a camera</strong>: The panoramic views of Amman's rolling hills and distinctive white
              buildings make for stunning photographs
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Amman's rooftop dining scene offers something for every taste and budget, from luxurious fine dining to
            casual cafes and traditional Jordanian experiences. What unites these diverse venues is the spectacular
            backdrop of the city's unique topography—a sea of white buildings cascading across numerous hills,
            punctuated by ancient ruins and modern skyscrapers. Whether you're seeking a romantic dinner, a casual
            coffee with a view, or an authentic taste of Jordanian cuisine, these elevated venues provide unforgettable
            experiences that combine culinary delights with Amman's breathtaking vistas.
