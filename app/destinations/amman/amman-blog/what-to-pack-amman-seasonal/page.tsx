          <h2>Understanding Amman's Climate</h2>

          <h3>Seasonal Temperature Variations</h3>
          <p>Amman experiences four distinct seasons, with significant temperature variations throughout the year:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Summer (June-August)</strong>: Hot and dry with daytime temperatures typically ranging from
              28-35°C (82-95°F). Nights are cooler, often dropping to 17-22°C (63-72°F).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fall (September-November)</strong>: Pleasant with gradually cooling temperatures. Daytime averages
              range from 20-28°C (68-82°F), while nights can drop to 10-15°C (50-59°F) by November.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Winter (December-February)</strong>: Cool and sometimes rainy with daytime temperatures between
              8-14°C (46-57°F). Nights can be quite cold, occasionally dropping below freezing. Snow is possible but not
              common.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spring (March-May)</strong>: Mild and increasingly warm with daytime temperatures ranging from
              15-25°C (59-77°F). Nights remain cool, especially in early spring.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Microclimates and Elevation</h3>
          <p>Amman's hilly topography creates microclimates across the city:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Elevation</strong>: The city sits at approximately 700-1,100 meters (2,300-3,600 feet) above sea
              level, which contributes to cooler temperatures than other Middle Eastern cities at similar latitudes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature variations</strong>: Western Amman (higher elevation) is typically a few degrees
              cooler than eastern and downtown areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wind exposure</strong>: Hilltop areas can be significantly windier, especially in winter and
              spring.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Other Climate Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Humidity</strong>: Amman has a dry climate year-round, with humidity typically below 50%.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rainfall</strong>: Precipitation is concentrated in winter months (December-February), with
              occasional showers in late fall and early spring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sun intensity</strong>: Due to the city's elevation and clear skies, UV exposure can be intense
              even when temperatures are moderate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dust storms</strong>: Occasional khamsin dust storms can occur in spring and early summer,
              reducing visibility and air quality.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dress Code Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            Jordan is relatively moderate compared to some neighboring countries, but respecting local dress norms is
            important, especially in certain areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>For women:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Clothing that covers shoulders and knees is appropriate in most public settings</li>
                <li>Loose-fitting clothes are preferable to tight or revealing items</li>
                <li>
                  A light scarf is useful for visiting mosques (where head covering is required) or more conservative
                  areas
                </li>
                <li>More conservative dress is expected in Downtown Amman and traditional neighborhoods</li>
                <li>
                  Western Amman (Abdoun, Sweifieh) is more relaxed, but still more conservative than Western countries
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>T-shirts are fine, but sleeveless shirts may draw attention in some areas</li>
                <li>Smart-casual attire is expected at nicer restaurants and business settings</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Religious sites:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Women should cover hair, shoulders, and knees when visiting mosques</li>
                <li>Men should wear long pants and avoid sleeveless shirts</li>
                <li>
                  Everyone should remove shoes when entering prayer areas (bring socks if you prefer not to go barefoot)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Appropriate Attire for Different Settings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>

              women)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tourist sites:</strong> Comfortable, modest clothing with good sun protection
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Downtown and traditional markets:</strong> More conservative dress recommended
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Private beaches and hotel pools:</strong> Standard swimwear is acceptable, though women might feel
              more comfortable in more modest styles
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dead Sea public beaches:</strong> More modest swimwear recommended
            </li>

          <h3>Ramadan Considerations</h3>
          <p>If visiting during Ramadan (dates vary each year), pack with these additional considerations in mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>More conservative clothing</strong> as a sign of respect during the holy month
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Snacks for your hotel room</strong> as many restaurants are closed during daylight hours
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Water bottle with discreet carrying case</strong> if you need to hydrate during the day
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Light jacket or wrap</strong> for late-night outings, as social activities shift to after iftar
              (breaking of the fast)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What Not to Pack</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Revealing clothing</strong> that would be culturally inappropriate

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Politically sensitive materials</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Alcohol</strong> in large quantities (available in Jordan but subject to import restrictions)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Shopping in Amman: What to Buy vs. Pack</h2>
          <p>Some items are better purchased in Amman than brought from home:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Traditional clothing</strong> like keffiyeh scarves or embroidered items
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dead Sea products</strong> (cheaper and more authentic than exported versions)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic toiletries</strong> (shampoo, soap, toothpaste) if you're trying to pack light
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spices and food souvenirs</strong>

          <p>
