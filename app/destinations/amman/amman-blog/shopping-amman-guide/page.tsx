            remember your trip.
          </p>

          <h2>Traditional Souks and Markets</h2>

          <h3>Downtown Souks (Al-Balad)</h3>
          <p>
            The heart of traditional shopping in Amman is found in the downtown area, where a network of specialized
            souks offers an authentic Middle Eastern market experience. Here you'll find:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Gold Souk</strong> - Located near King Hussein Street, this market features dozens of jewelers
              selling gold and silver pieces. Jordan is known for high-quality gold, often sold by weight plus
              craftsmanship fees. Even if you're not buying, the dazzling displays are worth seeing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spice Market</strong> - Near the Husseini Mosque, colorful pyramids of aromatic spices create a
              feast for the senses. Look for za'atar (a thyme and sesame blend), sumac, saffron, and unique spice mixes
              for various Jordanian dishes. Most vendors will vacuum-seal purchases for travel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Souk Al-Bukhariya</strong> - This market specializes in traditional clothing, textiles, and
              souvenirs. It's an excellent place to find keffiyeh scarves, embroidered dresses, and Bedouin jewelry.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Souk Al-Khudra</strong> - The vegetable market offers a glimpse into everyday Jordanian life, with
              vendors selling fresh produce, nuts, dates, and olives.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Shopping tips:</strong> Visit in the morning for a calmer experience, be prepared to bargain
            (politely start around 60-70% of the initial asking price), and bring cash as many smaller vendors don't
            accept cards.
          </p>

          <h3>Souk Jara (Seasonal)</h3>
          <p>
            Operating on Fridays during summer months (May to October) in Jabal Amman, Souk Jara is an open-air market
            featuring local artisans and designers. This is the perfect place to find:

            <li>Artwork by local artists</li>
            <li>Organic food products and homemade preserves</li>

            <li>Upcycled and eco-friendly crafts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The market has a festive atmosphere with occasional live music and food stalls, making it as much a social
            event as a shopping destination.
          </p>

          <h3>Friday Market (Souk Al-Juma'a)</h3>
          <p>
            Located in Ras Al-Ain, this sprawling flea market operates only on Fridays. It's a treasure hunter's
            paradise where you can find:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vintage and secondhand clothing</li>
            <li>Antiques and collectibles</li>
            <li>Household items and furniture</li>
            <li>Electronics and tools</li>
            <li>Unexpected oddities and curiosities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Shopping tips:</strong> Arrive early for the best selection, bring small bills, and be prepared for
            crowds and a bit of chaos. Keep valuables secure as the market can get very busy.

          <h2>Shopping Etiquette and Tips</h2>

          <h3>Bargaining</h3>
          <p>
            Bargaining is expected in traditional souks and markets, but not in malls or boutique shops with fixed
            prices. When bargaining:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be respectful and keep the interaction friendly</li>
            <li>Start around 60-70% of the asking price</li>
            <li>Be prepared to meet somewhere in the middle</li>
            <li>Don't begin bargaining unless you're genuinely interested in buying</li>
            <li>
              Remember that a few dinars may mean more to the vendor than to you—aim for a fair price, not the absolute
              lowest
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Tax Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            Jordan offers a VAT refund for tourists on purchases over 100 JOD from registered retailers. Look for the
            "Tax Free Shopping" logo, and ask for a special receipt. You can claim your refund at Queen Alia
            International Airport before departure.
          </p>

          <h3>Shipping Options</h3>
          <p>
            For larger purchases, many shops can arrange international shipping. Aramex and DHL have numerous locations
            throughout Amman if you need to ship items yourself. Some handicraft shops, particularly those catering to
            tourists, offer shipping services for bulkier items like rugs or large ceramics.
          </p>

          <h3>Shopping Hours</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Traditional Markets</strong>: Generally open from around 9 AM to 8 PM, with some closing for
              Friday prayers
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Malls</strong>: Typically open from 10 AM to 10 PM, seven days a week

              <strong>Boutiques</strong>: Usually open from 10 AM to 8 PM, with some closing on Fridays
            </li>
            <li>During Ramadan, shopping hours often extend late into the night after iftar (breaking of the fast)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Responsible Shopping</h2>
          <p>Support local communities and sustainable practices by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Purchasing from organizations like Jordan River Foundation or Iraq Al-Amir Women's Cooperative, which
              support women's economic empowerment
            </li>
            <li>
              Looking for the "Jordan Handicrafts" certification mark, which guarantees authentic, locally-made products
            </li>
            <li>
              Buying from Wild Jordan shops, where proceeds support nature conservation and local communities around
              Jordan's nature reserves
            </li>
            <li>Avoiding products made from endangered species or antiquities (which are illegal to export)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            From ancient souks to gleaming malls, Amman's diverse shopping landscape offers something for every taste
            and budget. By exploring different neighborhoods and markets, you'll not only find unique treasures to take
