          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Taxis</strong> - Abundant and affordable; no car seats provided, so bring your own if needed
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ride-sharing apps</strong> - Uber and Careem operate in Amman and allow you to request larger
              vehicles
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Walking</strong> - Many attractions in specific neighborhoods are walkable, but be aware of
              Amman's hilly terrain and limited sidewalks
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public buses</strong> - Generally not recommended for tourists with children due to crowding and
              limited information
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sun protection</strong> - Amman's elevation means intense sun; bring hats, sunscreen, and

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Water</strong> - Carry bottled water; tap water is generally safe but has a mineral taste children

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Medical facilities</strong> - Excellent private hospitals with English-speaking staff; keep your
              travel insurance information handy
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pharmacies</strong> - Well-stocked and numerous; pharmacists often speak English and can recommend
              medications for minor ailments
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cultural Considerations</h3>

            <li>
              <strong>Child-friendly culture</strong> - Jordanians adore children and will often interact with your kids
