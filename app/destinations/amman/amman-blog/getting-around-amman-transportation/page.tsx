            Navigating Amman can be an adventure in itself. Built across numerous hills, Jordan's capital presents
            unique transportation challenges and opportunities. While the city lacks a comprehensive metro or tram
            system, visitors have several options for getting around, from traditional taxis to modern ride-hailing
            apps. This guide will help you understand the various transportation methods available in Amman, their
            costs, advantages, and limitations, so you can explore the city with confidence.
          </p>

          <h2>Taxis in Amman</h2>

          <h3>Yellow Taxis</h3>
          <p>
            The ubiquitous yellow taxis are the most visible form of public transportation in Amman. They're abundant,
            relatively affordable, and can be hailed directly from the street.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>How to use them:</strong> Simply raise your hand to flag down an empty taxi (look for the green
              light on top indicating availability). Tell the driver your destination before getting in to ensure they
              know where you're going.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meters:</strong> All yellow taxis are required to use meters. The starting fare is 0.25 JOD, with
              additional charges of approximately 0.35 JOD per kilometer. Always insist on using the meter to avoid
              overcharging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Language considerations:</strong> Many taxi drivers speak limited English. It's helpful to have
              your destination written in Arabic, know major landmarks near your destination, or be able to show the
              location on a map app.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Typical costs:</strong> A ride within central Amman typically costs between 2-5 JOD depending on
              distance and traffic. Longer journeys, such as to the airport, will cost more (around 20-25 JOD).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tips:</strong> Tipping is not expected but rounding up to the nearest dinar is appreciated for
              good service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Widely available, relatively inexpensive, no need for advance booking
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Potential language barriers, some drivers may refuse to use the meter with tourists,
            quality of vehicles varies
          </p>

          <h3>White Taxis (Service Taxis)</h3>
          <p>
            White taxis, also known as "service" taxis, operate on fixed routes like buses but with the comfort of a
            car. They're shared with other passengers and only depart when full.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>How to use them:</strong> Find the appropriate service taxi station for your desired route
              (usually located near major transportation hubs). Tell the driver your destination to confirm it's on
              their route.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Routes:</strong> Service taxis typically run between specific neighborhoods or from Amman to
              nearby cities. Common routes include Downtown to University of Jordan, Sweileh, or Madaba.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Costs:</strong> Fares are fixed based on the route, typically ranging from 0.35-0.70 JOD for
              routes within Amman. Intercity routes cost more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Capacity:</strong> Service taxis typically carry 4-5 passengers, with 3-4 in the back seat and 1
              in the front.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Very economical, fixed prices, good for common routes
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited routes, can be crowded, wait times until the taxi fills up, not ideal for
            tourists with limited local knowledge
          </p>

          <h2>Ride-Hailing Apps</h2>

          <h3>Uber</h3>
          <p>
            Uber operates throughout Amman and offers a convenient alternative to traditional taxis, especially for
            visitors concerned about language barriers or negotiating fares.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>How to use it:</strong> Download the Uber app and create an account before your trip. The app
              works the same way as in other countries, allowing you to set your pickup location and destination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vehicle types:</strong> Uber offers several service levels in Amman, including UberX (standard

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment:</strong> Credit cards linked to your account or cash (select "cash" as your payment
              method in the app).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Costs:</strong> Generally 10-20% more expensive than yellow taxis when using the meter, but the
              convenience and reliability often justify the premium.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coverage:</strong> Available throughout Amman and for trips to nearby cities like Madaba, the Dead
              Sea, and even Petra (though long-distance trips can be expensive).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> No language barrier issues, no haggling over prices, driver and route tracking for
            safety, generally newer and more comfortable vehicles
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Slightly more expensive than metered taxis, requires data connection, may have surge
            pricing during peak times
          </p>

          <h3>Careem</h3>
          <p>
            Careem, now owned by Uber but operating as a separate service, is another popular ride-hailing option in
            Amman with strong local roots in the Middle East.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>How to use it:</strong> Similar to Uber, download the Careem app and create an account. The
              interface is intuitive and offers similar functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vehicle types:</strong> Careem offers various car types including Economy, Business (premium
              cars), and Max (larger vehicles).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment:</strong> Credit cards or cash, with cash being a popular option in Amman.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Costs:</strong> Comparable to Uber, sometimes with slight variations in pricing depending on
              demand and promotions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coverage:</strong> Excellent coverage throughout Amman and surrounding areas.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Similar advantages to Uber, sometimes better local knowledge, occasional promotions
            and discounts
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Similar to Uber, though some users report varying levels of service between the two
            platforms
          </p>

          <h2>Public Buses</h2>

          <h3>City Buses</h3>
          <p>
            Amman has an extensive but somewhat confusing bus network that covers most of the city. While not always the
            most tourist-friendly option, buses are extremely economical.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Types of buses:</strong> Amman has several bus systems operating simultaneously:

              holidays.

          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Very economical, good way to experience local life, environmentally friendly
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Confusing for visitors, limited English signage, can be crowded, schedules are
            irregular, not ideal for those with limited time
          </p>

            The relatively new Bus Rapid Transit system offers a more modern and efficient bus experience, operating on
            dedicated lanes to avoid traffic congestion.

              off-peak times.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Fast, reliable, modern vehicles with air conditioning, avoids traffic congestion
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited route network (though expanding), requires purchasing a special card

          <h2>Walking in Amman</h2>
          <p>
            Walking can be a pleasant way to explore certain neighborhoods in Amman, though the city's hilly topography
            and sometimes limited pedestrian infrastructure present challenges.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Walkable areas:</strong> Rainbow Street and Jabal Amman, Jabal Al-Weibdeh, parts of Downtown
              (though crowded), Abdali Boulevard
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Challenges:</strong> Steep hills, inconsistent sidewalks, limited pedestrian crossings on major
              roads, hot summers
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigation:</strong> Streets don't always follow a grid pattern, and addresses can be confusing.
              Using Google Maps or other navigation apps is highly recommended.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety:</strong> Amman is generally very safe for pedestrians in terms of crime, but be cautious
              of traffic, especially when crossing busy streets.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tips for pedestrians:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wear comfortable shoes with good grip for the steep and sometimes slippery streets</li>
            <li>Carry water, especially in summer months</li>
            <li>Be prepared for significant elevation changes</li>
            <li>Use pedestrian bridges where available for crossing major roads</li>
            <li>
              Consider combining walking in specific neighborhoods with taxis or ride-hailing apps for longer distances
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Rental Cars and Driving</h2>
          <p>
            Renting a car gives you maximum flexibility but comes with challenges in a city known for its traffic
            congestion and unique driving culture.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Requirements:</strong> Valid driver's license (an International Driving Permit is recommended but
              not always required), major credit card, minimum age typically 21-25 depending on the rental company
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rental companies:</strong> Major international companies (Hertz, Avis, Budget) have offices at
              Queen Alia International Airport and in central Amman, alongside local companies that may offer lower
              rates
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Costs:</strong> Starting from around 25-35 JOD per day for a basic car, plus fuel (relatively
              inexpensive in Jordan)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Parking:</strong> Can be challenging in busy areas. Look for paid parking lots near major
              attractions and commercial areas. Some hotels offer free parking for guests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Traffic:</strong> Congestion is common during rush hours (roughly 7:30-9:30 AM and 3:30-6:30 PM).
              Traffic rules are sometimes treated as suggestions rather than laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigation:</strong> Street signs are in both Arabic and English. GPS or navigation apps are
              highly recommended.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pros:</strong> Maximum flexibility, convenient for day trips outside Amman, no need to negotiate
            with taxi drivers
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cons:</strong> Traffic congestion, aggressive driving culture, limited parking, one-way streets and
            complex road systems can be confusing
          </p>

          <h2>Airport Transportation</h2>

          <h3>Getting to/from Queen Alia International Airport</h3>
          <p>
            The airport is located about 35 kilometers south of central Amman, with several transportation options
            available:

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If arriving late at night, pre-arrange transportation as options may be more limited.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Terrain:</strong> The city's steep hills and numerous stairs can be difficult to navigate for
              those with mobility limitations
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sidewalks:</strong> Often narrow, uneven, with high curbs and few ramps

              features
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
          <p>Transportation costs in Amman can vary widely depending on your choices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Budget option:</strong> Public buses (0.35-0.55 JOD per ride) combined with some walking
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mid-range:</strong> Yellow taxis using meters (2-5 JOD for most in-city trips)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Convenient option:</strong> Ride-hailing apps (slightly more than metered taxis)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Premium:</strong> Private drivers (50-80 JOD per day) or rental cars (25-35 JOD per day plus fuel)

          <ul>
            <li>Stay in a central location to minimize transportation needs</li>
            <li>Combine walking with occasional taxis rather than taking taxis for every journey</li>
            <li>
              For groups of 3-4 people, taxis or Uber/Careem can be more economical per person than individual bus fares
              for some journeys
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider the Jordan Pass if visiting multiple attractions, as it includes entry fees to many sites (though
              not transportation)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
