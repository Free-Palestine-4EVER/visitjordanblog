        <h2>Planning Your Visit to the Baptism Site</h2>
        <p>
          Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas) is one of Jordan's most significant religious and historical sites. As
          the location where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist according to Christian tradition, it attracts
          visitors from around the world. To make the most of your visit to this UNESCO World Heritage site, here are
          some essential tips to keep in mind.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li>✓ Guided tours are mandatory and included in your entrance fee</li>
            <li>✓ Dress modestly with shoulders and knees covered</li>
            <li>✓ Bring water, sun protection, and comfortable walking shoes</li>
            <li>✓ Allow 2-3 hours for a complete visit</li>
            <li>✓ Photography is permitted in most areas</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>
          The baptism site is open year-round, but the best times to visit are during spring (March to May) and autumn
          (September to November) when temperatures are most pleasant. Summer months can be extremely hot, with
          temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F), making it uncomfortable to walk around the outdoor site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in witnessing special religious ceremonies, consider visiting on January 6th (Epiphany)
          when various Christian denominations hold baptism and blessing ceremonies at the site. However, be prepared
          for larger crowds during this time.
        </p>

        <h2>Dress Code and Cultural Etiquette</h2>
        <p>
          As a religious site, modest dress is required at Bethany Beyond the Jordan. Both men and women should wear
          clothing that covers shoulders and knees. If you're planning to be baptized or enter the water, bring
          appropriate clothing for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this is a place of worship for many visitors, so maintain a respectful demeanor throughout your
          visit. Keep your voice down near prayer areas and be mindful of those who may be having spiritual experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>Guided Tours and What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          All visitors must join a guided tour, which is included in your entrance fee. Tours depart regularly
          throughout the day and are conducted in various languages. Your guide will lead you through the archaeological
          site, explaining the historical and religious significance of different areas.
        </p>
        <p>The tour typically includes visits to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The remains of Byzantine churches and monasteries</li>
          <li>John the Baptist Church</li>
          <li>The Jordan River baptism site</li>
          <li>Elijah's Hill</li>
          <li>Various prayer halls and modern churches</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The entire tour takes approximately 1.5 to 2 hours and involves walking on designated paths. Some areas may
          not be accessible to those with mobility issues, though efforts have been made to improve accessibility.
        </p>

        <h2>Photography Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Photography is permitted in most areas of the baptism site, but be respectful when taking photos, especially
          of people who are praying or participating in religious ceremonies. Some specific areas or modern churches may
          have restrictions on photography, which your guide will inform you about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best light for photography is typically in the morning or late afternoon when the sun is lower in the sky,
          creating warmer tones and more dramatic shadows across the archaeological remains.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Information</h2>
        <h3>Opening Hours</h3>
        <p>
          The site is open daily from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM in winter (October to March) and from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM in
          summer (April to September). The last tour typically departs about 1-1.5 hours before closing time.
        </p>

        <h3>Entrance Fees</h3>
        <p>
          The entrance fee is approximately 12 JOD per person, which includes the mandatory guided tour. The Jordan Pass
          also covers entry to this site.
        </p>
