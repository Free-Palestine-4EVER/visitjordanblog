          Located on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas in Arabic) is one of
          the most significant religious sites in the world. Recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, this is
          believed to be the location where John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ, marking the beginning of Christ's
          ministry and a pivotal moment in Christian history.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Biblical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel of John specifically mentions "Bethany beyond the Jordan" as the place where John the Baptist was
          baptizing (John 1:28). The site's religious importance extends beyond Christianity, as it is also revered in
          Islam and Judaism for its connections to various prophets mentioned in the Quran and the Old Testament.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the New Testament, after Jesus was baptized, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended
          upon him like a dove, while a voice from heaven proclaimed, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well
          pleased" (Matthew 3:16-17). This theophany (manifestation of God) marks one of the most important events in
          Christian theology.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Historical Context and Archaeological Discoveries</h2>
        <p>
          Archaeological excavations at Bethany Beyond the Jordan began in earnest after the 1994 peace treaty between
          Jordan and Israel. These excavations have uncovered numerous Byzantine and Roman ruins, including churches,
          baptismal pools, a monastery, and hermit caves, dating from the Roman and Byzantine periods (2nd to 15th
          centuries AD).
        </p>

        <p>
          The site contains the remains of five different churches, a large baptismal pool, and a water reticulation
          system that demonstrates the importance of this location to early Christians. Pilgrims have been visiting this
          site since at least the 4th century AD, as documented in the accounts of early Christian pilgrims.
