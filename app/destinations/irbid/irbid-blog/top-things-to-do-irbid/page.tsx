          Housed in an Ottoman-era building that once served as a government center, Dar As-Saraya Museum is Irbid's
          archaeological museum. The museum showcases artifacts from various periods of Jordan's history, including the

        <p>
          Take a leisurely walk through Irbid's old town center, where you'll find traditional architecture, narrow
          streets, and local shops. The area around Al-Hashimi Street is particularly vibrant, with vendors selling
          everything from fresh produce to handmade crafts. This is an excellent opportunity to experience daily life in
          a Jordanian city away from the tourist crowds.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Visit Yarmouk University</h2>
        <p>
          As one of Jordan's premier educational institutions, Yarmouk University contributes significantly to Irbid's
          identity as a university city. The campus features modern architecture, beautiful gardens, and a museum of
          Jordanian heritage. Even if you're not a student, walking through the campus gives you a sense of the academic
          atmosphere that defines much of Irbid's culture.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Shop at the Irbid Central Market (Souk)</h2>
        <p>
          For an authentic local experience, visit Irbid's bustling central market. Here, you'll find vendors selling
          fresh fruits, vegetables, spices, clothing, and household goods. The market is a feast for the senses, with
          colorful displays, aromatic spices, and the lively chatter of vendors and shoppers. Don't forget to practice
          your bargaining skills!

        <h2>5. Try Local Jordanian Cuisine</h2>

          Irbid offers numerous restaurants and street food vendors where you can sample traditional Jordanian dishes.
          Be sure to try mansaf (Jordan's national dish of lamb cooked in yogurt sauce), maqluba (an "upside-down" dish
          of rice, vegetables, and meat), and knafeh (a sweet cheese pastry soaked in syrup). Hashim Street is known for
          its excellent local eateries.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Visit the Jordan University of Science and Technology</h2>

          Another prestigious educational institution in Irbid, JUST (Jordan University of Science and Technology) has
          an impressive campus worth visiting. The university is known for its medical and engineering programs and
          features modern facilities and beautiful grounds. The contrast between this contemporary campus and Irbid's

        <p>
          Another excellent day trip from Irbid is to Ajloun Castle, about 50 kilometers southwest. This 12th-century
          Muslim castle was built by one of Saladin's generals and offers panoramic views of the surrounding
          countryside. The castle's strategic location and well-preserved architecture make it a fascinating historical
